DiR (Design is Refactoring):
  > OCP (Open/Closed Principle)
    - code is open for changes but closed for modifications
    - when adding new feature:
      1. add new method that contains the feature
      2. pass new tests
      3. delete old method that need refactoring
      4. pass tests again
    - code is never OCP all the time. It depends on the feature I want to add
    - code would never break when using OCP all tests should past in every next step
